# Members-only
ruby on rails project

In this project, you‚Äôll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.



## About the project

In this project, we implemented authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.
This assignment consists of using the Devise gem to have a first approach at authentication in rails. We built an application that allows users to create posts and the authors of the posts are displayed only if as a User you are logged in.


## Built With

-ruby on rails
-ruby
